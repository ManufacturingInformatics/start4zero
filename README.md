Give an idea about GitHub, and teach you get on GitHub step by step

## 00 What is GitHub

everything I want to say is here [check this video](https://youtu.be/w3jLJU7DT5E)

## 01 Register GitHub

*if you have your personal GitHub account, please see next step*

1. open [github.com](https://github.com)

2. Click `sign in`

3. Use your **University email** to register

## 02 Apply education pack

Why? GitHub is not totally free. Open source repository is free, but do you really want your yet to publish work be open to everyone? No!
So you need private repository. Private repository is paid service, but with education pack, it can be free to use for non-commercial.

1. go to [education page](https://education.github.com/) (with your account log in)

2. click `request a discount`
or use this [link](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new)

3. fill your information
`researcher` `individual account`

4. submit and wait at your email inbox

5. got an confirm email (normally instantly)

6. look what you can have with [education pack](https://education.github.com/pack/offers) with a snap

I will introduce some tools later

## 03 Step on board （join our group）

1. let me (*[Boyang](https://github.com/hidesoon), as the maintainer atm*) know your account ID
2. then I will invite you to access [our lab](https://github.com/ManufacturingInformatics)
3. accept the invitation
4. view the org page, look our repositories

## 04 View repository (main body of GitHub)

1. open one [example: lab management](https://github.com/ManufacturingInformatics/LabManagement)

## 05 View project management

This is a Kanban system
